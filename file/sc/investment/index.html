<h1>Starcorp investment</h1>
<p>We've decided to invest in Project Boomerang. Apparantly the NSAB is counting on us for all the money now.</p>
<p>We told them to appoint Koala as the lead scientist and Kangaroo as the co-lead. Although I think that even if we didn't say anything they would've appointed them anyways. Nobody would look anywhere else when it comes to quantum gimmicks.</p>
<p>I chose Robin because I know him personally and admire his talent. He isn't from the University of Flower City, so I don't really know how Koala and Kangaroo would react to that. I just hope they would recognize him instead of doing some furious gatekeeping. They don't seem like that kind of people.</p>
