<p>We've decided to invest in Project Boomerang. Apparantly the <span class="name bauhinia">NSAB</span> is counting on us for all the money now.</p>
<p>We told them to appoint <span class="name koala">Koala</span> as the lead scientist and <span class="name kangaroo">Kangaroo</span> as the co-lead. Although I think that even if we didn't say anything they would've appointed them anyways. Nobody would look anywhere else when it comes to quantum gimmicks.</p>
<p>I chose Robin because I know him personally and admire his talent. He isn't from the University of Flower City, so I don't really know how <span class="name koala">Koala</span> and <span class="name kangaroo">Kangaroo</span> would react to that. I just hope they would recognize him instead of doing some furious gatekeeping. They don't seem like that kind of people.</p>
