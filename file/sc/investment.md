# Starcorp investment

We've decided to invest in Project Boomerang. Apparantly the NSAB is counting on us for all the money now.

We told them to appoint Koala as the lead scientist and Kangaroo as the co-lead. Although I think that even if we didn't say anything they would've appointed them anyways. Nobody would look anywhere else when it comes to quantum gimmicks.

I chose Robin because I know him personally and admire his talent. He isn't from the University of Flower City, so I don't really know how Koala and Kangaroo would react to that. I just hope they would recognize him instead of doing some furious gatekeeping. They don't seem like that kind of people.
