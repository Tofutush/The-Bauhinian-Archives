<p>In order to maintain a competitive advantage in the field of quantum physics, I propose a Project Boomerang aimed at the research of time-manipulation technologies and the creation of practical time-manipulation devices.</p>
<p>Due to the sensitive nature of this project, a laboratory shall be set up in a confidential location in southern Bauhinia.</p>
<p>Investment request has been sent to Starcorp. They have taken an interest in this project and have been sworn to secrecy under the condition that they would appoint the Heads of Research. I did not object.</p>
